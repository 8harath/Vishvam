    Artificial Intelligence Overview
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create 
    intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.
    
    Machine Learning Fundamentals  
    Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data without 
    being explicitly programmed. It uses statistical techniques to give computers the 
    ability to learn and improve from experience.
    
    Types of Machine Learning
    1. Supervised Learning: Uses labeled training data to learn patterns and make predictions.
    2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples.
    3. Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties.
    
    Deep Learning Applications
    Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers.
    It has revolutionized fields like computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
    Applications include image recognition, language translation, and autonomous vehicles.
