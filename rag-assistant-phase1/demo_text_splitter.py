    INSTALLATION GUIDE
    
    1. Mounting the Controller
    Mount the controller in a dry, well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight and heat sources.
    Use the provided mounting screws to secure the unit to a wall or surface.
    
    2. Connecting LED Strips
    Connect your LED strips to the output terminals. Each channel supports up to 2A current draw.
    Ensure proper polarity when connecting (red = positive, black = negative).
    
    3. Power Connection
    Connect the provided power adapter to the controller and plug into a standard wall outlet.
    The power LED will illuminate green when properly connected.
